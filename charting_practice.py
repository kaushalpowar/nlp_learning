# Charting practice
#In this exercise, you'll use some extracted named entities and their groupings
#from a series of newspaper articles to chart the diversity of named entity types
#in the articles.

#You'll use a defaultdict called ner_categories, with keys representing every
#named entity group type, and values to count the number of each different named
#entity type. You have a chunked sentence list called chunked_sentences similar
#to the last exercise, but this time with non-binary category names.

#You can use hasattr() to determine if each chunk has a 'label' and then simply
#use the chunk's .label() method as the dictionary key.


# Create the defaultdict: ner_categories
ner_categories = defaultdict(int)

# Create the nested for loop
for sent in chunked_sentences:
    for chunk in sent:
        if hasattr(chunk, 'label'):
            ner_categories[chunk.label()] += 1
            
# Create a list from the dictionary keys for the chart labels: labels
labels = list(ner_categories.keys())

# Create a list of the values: values
values = [ner_categories.get(v) for v in labels]

# Create the pie chart
plt.pie(values, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)

# Display the chart
plt.show()
