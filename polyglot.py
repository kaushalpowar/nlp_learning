#French NER with polyglot I
#In this exercise and the next, you'll use the polyglot library to identify
#French entities. The library functions slightly differently than spacy,
#so you'll use a few of the new things you learned in the last video to
#display the named entity text and category.

#You have access to the full article string in article. Additionally,
#the Text class of polyglot has been imported from polyglot.text.

# Create a new text object using Polyglot's Text class: txt
txt = Text(article)

# Print each of the entities found
for ent in txt.entities:
    print(ent)
    
# Print the type of ent
print(type(ent))
