#CountVectorizer for text classification
'''It's time to begin building your text classifier!
The data has been loaded into a DataFrame called df. Explore it in the
IPython Shell to investigate what columns you can use. The .head() method
is particularly informative.

In this exercise, you'll use pandas alongside scikit-learn to create a sparse
text vectorizer you can use to train and test a simple supervised model.
To begin, you'll set up a CountVectorizer and investigate some of its
features.'''

# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# Print the head of df
print(df.head())

# Create a series to store the labels: y
y = df.label

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['text'],y,test_size=0.33, random_state=53)

# Initialize a CountVectorizer object: count_vectorizer
count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Transform the training data using only the 'text' column values: count_train 
count_train = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train.values)

# Transform the test data using only the 'text' column values: count_test 
count_test = count_vectorizer.transform(X_test.values)

# Print the first 10 features of the count_vectorizer
print(count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()[:10])
