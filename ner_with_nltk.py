#NER with NLTK
#You're now going to have some fun with named-entity recognition!
#A scraped news article has been pre-loaded into your workspace.
#Your task is to use nltk to find the named entities in this article.

#What might the article be about, given the names you found?

#Along with nltk, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize from nltk.tokenize
#have been pre-imported.

# Tokenize the article into sentences: sentences
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(article)

# Tokenize each sentence into words: token_sentences
token_sentences = [nltk.word_tokenize(sent) for sent in sentences]

# Tag each tokenized sentence into parts of speech: pos_sentences
pos_sentences = [nltk.pos_tag(sent) for sent in token_sentences] 

# Create the named entity chunks: chunked_sentences
chunked_sentences = nltk.ne_chunk_sents(pos_sentences, binary=True)

# Test for stems of the tree with 'NE' tags
for sent in chunked_sentences:
    for chunk in sent:
        if hasattr(chunk, "label") and chunk.label() == "NE":
            print(chunk)
#Output -->
